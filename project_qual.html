            <h1>Jade: Qualification</h1>
            <p>
                Hi! This is the qualification for the Jade: Financial Prompts project! Here, youâ€™ll upload financial filings and ask questions about them based on 3 question criteria. If your submission is successful, you will be let on to the Jade project, which has a pay rate of $35/hr! ðŸ˜Š
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do not have a background working with financial data, please skip this qualification! We are only looking for people who are competent in matters related to finance. As a rule of thumb, if you've never seen or worked with income statements or balance sheets, then youâ€™re probably out of scope for this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main goal of this project is to use publicly available financial filings from October 2023 or after and ask questions about them. These questions will be passed into a model so that we can test its ability to retrieve relevant information from PDF sources (that you will also provide).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong style="color: red;">Note: Please DO NOT include any PII anywhere in your submission.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The project instructions are as follows, please read them carefully before attempting the task below.

                <summary>Part 1: Finding Reports</summary>
                <p>
                    To begin, you need to locate publicly available financial filings (10-K and 10-Q only). These filings can be found on the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/search-filings" target="_blank">SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) EDGAR website</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please refer to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Pu5MTsrqzT5nAYGsN4innXV8IlNeoXQb5QEfyBXteo/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank">this visual guide</a> to find and download your desired reports. Optionally, you can follow these simple steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="https://www.sec.gov/search-filings" target="_blank">Go to EDGARâ€™s Search Filings page.</a></li>
                    <li>Search for your desired company (e.g., Apple, Nvidia, Abercrombie).</li>
                    <li>Select either 10-K or 10-Q reports only.</li>
                    <li>Click on the report youâ€™d like to use.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Make sure the reports you use are from or after October 2023, as specified in the project requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please upload at least three financial reports. This is done to make the model have to work harder to identify where its answer lies.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Part 2: URLs and filenames </summary>
                <p>
                    After downloading the reports, copy the links to their HTML version and paste them into the URLs box. Please put each URL on a new line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please also rename the PDF files to something other than the companyâ€™s code (to make it harder for the model to retrieve data).
                </p>
                
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Part 3: Your Question Categories</summary>
                <p>
                    Now for the interesting part!
                </p>
                <p>
                    After uploading your desired documents, you will need to ask two questions about only a single one of them. One category A question, another category B question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please refer to the following matrix regularly throughout your submissions to ensure you satisfy the requirements for each category.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Questions you ask should be about facts, numbers, or information that is readily available in the reports you uploaded. Please do not ask questions that require the model to make assumptions or predictions about the future, or to provide opinions or subjective analysis. The questions should be clear, concise, and specific to the information contained in the reports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please don't limit yourself to just asking about numbers. We also encourage you to ask about lawsuits, shareholders and whatever else you can think of that is contained in your uploaded report.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        This is the simplest category of the three. When writing up a Category A question, it should be simple, and ask about a single piece of information that is readily available in a single document. The following is an exhaustive list of examples as well as justifications for why the questions given would be classified under Category A.

                    <p>
                        As mentioned before, please only ask simple questions about a single document in this category.
                    </p>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Category B: Hard Questions About a Single Document</summary>
                        <p>
                            In this category, we want you to ask more difficult questions than Category A, but still about only one report. For a question to fall under this category, it must either:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Require information from multiple paragraphs</li>
                            <li>Require calculation of a number/information that isnâ€™t already available in the report</li>
                            <li>Or both!</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            For questions that require answers from separate paragraphs, this can be done by either stacking multiple questions on top of each other, or by asking a singular question that requires an elaborate response from multiple separate paragraphs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We understand stacking simple questions on top of each other is easier, but the time spent on the project is paid either way. The time you take to think of a high-quality and difficult prompt will not only put you ahead of others for future finance projects, but will be worthwhile and pay more as weâ€™ll be looking for workers with a good level of creativity!
                        </p>
                        <p>The following are some examples and their justifications for both types of Category B questions:</p>

                            Category B questions should challenge the model to perform deeper analysis while staying within the scope of a single document.

                            <summary>Category C: Hard Questions About Multiple Documents</summary>
                            <p>
                                This category is out of scope for this qual. However, it would be useful to read it so that youâ€™re better prepared for if youâ€™re let on to the main project!
                            <p>
                                We finally move on to Category C. In this category, you should be asking difficult questions about multiple documents. We recommend that you upload multiple reports in Categories A and B to make the model have to choose which one to use to answer your questions. For Category C, we want you to do the same but multiple times. For example, you can upload multiple reports from Apple (e.g., 2024 10-K, 2024 10-Q, and 2023 10-K), and do the same for other companies as well in the same submission.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We ask that you upload a minimum of three documents for this category, but the more you upload, the better! Anywhere from 2 to 40 is allowed. We recommend 30% of Category C submissions to be 2-10, and 70% to be 10+ documents uploaded. We will be regularly checking your submissions and the ratios of how often you upload more than 10 reports, so please follow this rule closely. It would make sense to upload reports of companies in the same sector, so you could perhaps ask general questions about that industry for a given time period (e.g., "What was the sum of the net profit for Apple and Nvidia in 2024?").
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You will need to ask hard questions that require using information from 2, 3, or more reports (up to 40). This can also be done by the same means used in Category B, by either stacking questions on top of each other or by asking difficult questions. The following are some examples of questions in both categories.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For questions that require answers from separate paragraphs, this can be done by either stacking multiple questions on top of each other, or by asking a singular question that requires an elaborate response from multiple separate paragraphs. Please keep the distribution for that 30-70 respectively. I.e., 70% of your Category B submissions should be asking the difficult questions, and 30% stacking questions on top of each other.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We understand stacking simple questions on top of each other is easier, but the time spent on the project is paid either way. The time you take to think of a high-quality and difficult prompt will not only put you ahead of others for future finance projects, but will be worthwhile and pay more!
